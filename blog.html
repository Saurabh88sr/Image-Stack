        <h1>What is Graphic Design?</h1>
        <p>Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. 
            By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, 
            designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ 
            specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in 
            interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.Graphic design is an ancient craft, 
            dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to at least 17,000-year-old cave paintings. 
            It’s a term that originated in the 1920s’ print industry. 
            It continues to cover a range of activities including logo creation. 
            Graphic design in this sense concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing. 
            Graphic designers attract viewers using images, color and typography. 
            However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX) design must 
            justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach. 
            That means you need to focus on—and seek to empathize the most with—your specific users while you 
            create good-looking designs that maximize usability.</p>
